# Getting Setup for Success

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5 Minutes_

There are two key resources you will be using in this workshop:

* An OpenShift cluster with the OpenShift GitOps operator pre-installed.
* Your own copy of the workshop Git repository.

The next two sections will walk you through getting access to these resources.

== Copying the Workshop Repository on GitHub

You'll need a GitHub account to complete this step. If you don't have one, go ahead and sign-up at https://github.com[github.com], then complete these steps:

. Login to https://github.com[github.com].
. Visit the workshop repository at: https://github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt[github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt]
. Click the **Use this template** button in the upper-right corner of the Git repository. A list of options will be displayed.
. Select the *Create a new repository* option.
. Use the following value for the the *Repository name* field:
+
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt
----
. Click the *Create repository from template* button.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You'll be asked to use this repository throughout the workshop. Make sure to always use *your copy*, and *not* the original one owned by _evanshortiss_ on GitHub!
====

Ensure your copy of the repository is linked to in subsequent sections of this guide:

. Enter your GitHub username or the name of the organisation you copied the template repository to in the top-right corner of this guide.
+

. Press the enter key once you've entered the username or organisation name. The field UI will reload and show your username.
+

You should now have a copy of the repository at a unique URL of your own at `https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt`.

== Access your OpenShift Cluster

You'll be using your own OpenShift cluster throughout this workshop. Your cluster is pre-configured with the **OpenShift Web Terminal** and **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** Operators. You can think of Operators as addons to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster that provide it with extended features/capabilities:

    * The **Web Terminal** makes it easy to use pre-authenticated command-line tools (CLIs) to interact with the OpenShift APIs directly from the **OpenShift Web Console** in your web browser.
    * Pre-installing the **Red Hat OpenShift GitOps** operator saved a few minutes of time so you can fully focus on actually learning about GitOps instead of setting it up!

To retrieve your cluster's information:

. Visit the https://summit.demo.redhat.com[summit.demo.redhat.com].
. Enter your email address and the password provided by the workshop administrator(s).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Use your actual email address. This is so you can use the same email and password again to access your cluster information if you lose access, or forget the cluster details.
====
+

. Click the *Access this workshop* button.
. Your unique environment details will be displayed.

The console URL and user marked a *Admin* are the two pieces of information from the *OpenShift Console Access* section that you need to access your cluster.

To access your OpenShift cluster's *Web Console*:

. Visit the cluster URL in a web browser, and select the *htpasswd_provider* login option when prompted.
+
image:ex1.openshift-login-screen.png[]
. Login to your OpenShift cluster using the *Admin* username and password provided by https://summit.demo.redhat.com[summit.demo.redhat.com].

The **Overview** page of the OpenShift Web Console is displayed after a successful login. From here you can perform both administrative and developer-focused tasks. 

== Access the OpenShift Web Terminal

From the OpenShift Web Console you just accessed:

. Verify that a terminal icon **>_** is shown in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Click the terminal icon. A new UI element will appear, and prepare a terminal session.
. Once the terminal session is ready type the `help` command, and press enter. This will display the pre-installed CLIs that are available in this wokshop environment.
+
image:ex1.web-terminal.png[]
. Run the `oc whoami` command in the Web Terminal and verify that the output is the same as the username you used to login to the OpenShift Web Console.
. Run the `oc project openshift-gitops` and `oc get pods` (or `kubectl get pods`) commands to change context to the pre-configured `openshift-gitops` namespace, and confirm the **OpenShift GitOps** components all display a status of *Running*.

== Summary

Nice work, you've successfully:

. Created a repository that will hold your cluster and application manifests.
. Signed into your OpenShift cluster.
. Learned how to access and use the OpenShift Web Terminal.
. Used the `oc` and `kubectl` CLIs to interact with resources on your cluster.
