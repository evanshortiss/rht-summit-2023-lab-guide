# Continuous Delivery of an Application

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 15 Minutes_

👨‍💻 _Role: Developer_

In this section you're no longer acting as a cluster administrator, but are instead playing the role of a developer. Time to stretch your developer legs as the `foo` user, and have Argo CD continuously deploy an application of yours into the development environment that was setup in prior sections.

The application you'll be using can be found at https://github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-sample-application[github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-sample-application]. This repository contains a simple web application that renders a web page containing a randomly chosen meme. The repository also contains a set of resources in the _k8s/_ directory that will be used to deploy the application on OpenShift. You're going to deploy this application into the `project-memes-dev` namespace, then make an update to the application Git repository that runs a CI pipeline, and observe how Argo CD detects the new changes and automatically deploys them to complete the CI/CD flow.

[NOTE]
====
Separating the OpenShift/Kubernetes resources and source code for an application into separate repositories is a common approach. To reduce the number of repositories you need to manage this workshop has placed both the source code and OpenShift/Kubernetes resources together in a single repository.

== Login to Argo CD as a Developer User

If you're not already logged into the Argo CD dashboard as the `foo` user:

. Login to the OpenShift Web Console using the following steps:
    * Select the *standard-users* provider.
    * Use the username: `foo`.
    * Use the password: `foopassword`.
    * Click the *Log in* button.
. Expand the *Application Launcher* icon (3x3 sqaure) in the top-right of the OpenShift Web Console.

. Click the **Cluster Argo CD** link. This will open a new browser tab.
. Accept the self-signed certificate warning if one appears. The login page will now appear.
. Click the **Log in via OpenShift** button.
. Login using the same *standard-users* identity provider, the `foo` username, and the `foopassword` password you used previously.

== Create the Random Meme Application

The `foo` user now has permission to create an Application that targets the `project-memes-dev` Namespace in the `in-cluster` destination. You observed this in the prior exercise by viewing the `project-memes` in the *Projects* section in the *Settings* screen.

Create an Argo CD Application to manage your containerised random meme web application:

. Visit the https://github.com/evanshortiss/rht-summit-2023-sample-application[random-meme application repository].
. Click the *Use this template* button, and select *Create a new repository* from the list of options that are displayed.
+

. Enter the following as the *Repository Name*.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
rht-summit-2023-sample-application
----
. Navigate to the Argo CD dashboard.
. Click the *New App* button. An overlay will appear.
. Switch to the YAML editor in the overlay using the *Edit as YAML* button.
. Fill in the form with the following information:
    * Application Name: `random-meme-dev` (Using any other value will result in an error. Feel free to try a different value to see what happens!)
    * Project: `project-memes`
    * Sync Policy: `Automatic`
    * Prune Resources: `Enabled`
    * Self Heal: `Enabled`
    * Repository URL: `https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-sample-application`
    * Path: `k8s/overlays/development`
    * Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
    * Namespace: `project-memes-dev` (Using any other value will result in an error. Feel free to try a different value to see what happens!)
. After filling out these details you can switch to the YAML view and confirm that it matches this screenshot:
+
image:ex8.argocd-application-yaml.png[]
. Click the *Create* button.

The Application creation should be a success, and a new *random-meme-dev* Application tile should be shown in the Argo CD dashboard. Clicking on the tile reveals the Application details. It should have synchronised successfully.

== Test the Containerised Application

Now that your containerised application has been deployed, go see what it does!

. Return to the OpenShift Web Console. Log in as either `foo` or `opentlc-mgr` user.
. Switch to the *Developer* perspective using the *Perspective Switcher*.
. Click the *Topology* link in the side-menu.
. Select the `project-memes-dev` from the *Project* dropdown.
. Click on the Node.js application in the topology. The application's details will appear on the right.
+

. Scroll down and click on the URL in the *Routes* section. A new browser tab will open and display a meme.

Excellent, you've just deployed a containerised application using Argo CD!
