# Verifying & Understanding the AppProject and RBAC Rules

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5 Minutes_

👨‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator and/or Developers_

== Explore your new Applications and Project with Custom RBAC

Before moving on and seeing the effects of the newly synced Application resources, review the https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/rbac/groups/group.developers.yaml[group.developers.yaml] and https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/rbac/groups/group.operations.yaml[group.operations.yaml] files. These are simple Group CRs that define a list of Users that are part of a Group.

[NOTE]
====
You could add more users to the `users` list in either of these resources if you wanted to in the future. For the purposes of this workshop we need only small groups. Realistically, you'd probably add multiple users to a group.

View these synchronised files in Argo CD:

. Login to the Argo CD dashboard as the `admin` user.
. Select the *rbac* application.
. Click the *application-dev* resource in the tree view. An overlay will appear.
. Select the *Desired Manifest* tab in the overlay.
+

This Group CR defines corresponds to the _group.developers.yaml_ file, and creates a group named *application-dev* that contains a single user named *foo*. The *application-ops* Group contains the *bar* user.

Next, take a look at the *argo-projects* Application:

. Login to the Argo CD dashboard as the `admin` user.
. Select the *argo-projects* application.
. Click the *project-memes* resource in the tree view. An overlay will appear.
. Select the *Desired Manifest* tab in the overlay.
+

This file is synchronised from the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/argocd-projects/app-project.memes.yaml[argocd-projects/app-project.memes.yaml]_ in your Git repository - it's important and contains various comments explaining what it does! The main thing to take away is that it:

* Creates an https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#projects[AppProject].
* Supports multiple `destinations` (target clusters), though there's only one defined in this example; the local cluster into which it has been applied.
* Limits the target Namespaces to `project-memes-dev` and `project-memes-prod`, and *does not* whitelist any cluster-scoped resources. This is important; we want to restrict this project to managing only resources in a the defined Namespaces and not at the cluster-level!
* Defines two roles: `memes-development` and `memes-operations`. Users in the `application-dev` and `application-ops` Groups created previously are associated with these, respectively.
* Defines independent RBAC policies for the `memes-development` and `memes-operations` roles.

Now that the *rbac* and *argo-projects* Application resources are synchronised, verify they had the desired effect.

== Verify the Policies & RBAC

It's time to verify the AppProject, Group, and the roles and policies were applied as expected to the `foo` user. 

First, you'll need to log out and log in again to make sure the Group/RBAC changes are detected and applied by the Argo CD instance:

. Create a private browsing session in your web browser.
. Login to the OpenShift Web Console as the `foo` user by following these steps:
    * Select the *standard-users* identity provider.
    * Enter the username: `foo`.
    * Enter the password: `foopassword`.
    * Click the *Log in* button.
. Expand the *Application Launcher* icon (3x3 square) in the top-right of the OpenShift Web Console.

. Click the **Cluster Argo CD** link. This will open a new browser tab.
. Accept the self-signed certificate warning if one appears. The login page will now appear.
. Click the **Log in via OpenShift** button.
. Login using the same *standard-users* identity provider, the `foo` username, and the `foopassword` password you used previously when prompted.

Confirm that Argo CD can see that the `foo` user is a member of the `application-dev` Group:

. Click the *User Info* icon on the left-hand menu in the Argo CD dashboard.
. Confirm that the `foo` user's info shows that they're part of the `application-dev` Group:

Next, confirm the AppProject and roles:

. Click on the *Settings* (cog/wheel) icon on the left-hand menu in the Argo CD dashboard.
. Select *Projects* from the list of items. A `project-memes` Project should be listed.
. Click on the `project-memes` item in the Project list.
. Switch to the *Roles* tab and confirm that the `memes-development` and `memes-operations` items are listed.
. Click on the `memes-development` role. An overlay should appear.
+

. Confirm that the the *Groups* section in the overlay shows that the users in the `application-dev` group are bound to `memes-development` role in this Argo CD Project.

== Summary

Congratulations! You learned how to:

* Bootstrap a cluster with a set of Applications, templated using a Helm chart.
* Define Groups in OpenShift, and add OpenShift users to those Groups.
* Create Projects, Roles, and Policies in Argo CD using *AppProject* CRs.

In the next section you'll learn how to implement continuous deployment for a containerised application using Argo CD.
