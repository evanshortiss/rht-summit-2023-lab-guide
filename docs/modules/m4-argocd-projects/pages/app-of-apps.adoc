# The App of Apps Pattern

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5-10 Minutes_

👩‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator_

Earlier in this workshop you created some managed Namespaces and applied a ResourceQuota to them, but didn't deploy any resources into those Namespaces. That's because you were acting as an administrator, configuring Namespaces and OpenShift access for development teams. 

The previous section demonstrated that Argo CD has a concept of Projects, and that each Project enforces a set of RBAC policies. Enabling your development teams to use Argo CD requires creating Projects and crafting appropriate RBAC policies.

In this section you'll manage https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#projects[Argo Project CRs] and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/rest_api/user_and_group_apis/group-user-openshift-io-v1.html[Group CRs] using Argo CD. These CRs will enable the `foo` user to deploy their own Applications using Argo CD.

Instead of continuing to import and manage more Argo CD Applications one-by-one you'll learn how to use the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/cluster-bootstrapping/[App of Apps Pattern] to bootstrap multiple Applications at once. You'll also learn about the Argo CD CLI in the process.

== The Argo CD CLI

The Web Terminal in your environment has the Argo CD CLI pre-installed. Login to your Argo CD instance via the CLI:

. Login to the OpenShift Web Console as the `opentlc-mgr` user.
. Open the OpenShift Web Terminal using the *>_* icon.
. Verify the Argo CD CLI is available by trying to view the installed version of the CLI:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
argocd version
----
. Once you've confirmed the `argocd` binary is available, login to your Argo CD instance as the `admin` user:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export ARGO_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret openshift-gitops-cluster -o json -n openshift-gitops | jq '.data["admin.password"]' -r | base64 --decode)

argocd login openshift-gitops-server.openshift-gitops.svc.cluster.local \
--insecure \
--username admin \
--password $ARGO_PASSWORD
----
. List your current Applications using the following command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
argocd app list
----

The result displayed by the `argocd app list` should contain your *console-customisations* and *managed-namespaces* Applications and their status.

== Creating the App of Apps

Time to deploy the App of Apps. You can find the manifests for the App of Apps in the _apps/_ folder of https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt[your copy of the workshop repository]. Take a look inside the _apps/_ folder; you'll see that it's a https://helm.sh/[Helm chart]. Don't worry if you're not familiar with Helm charts, it's basically a system for building fully formed YAML from a set of templates and variables/values:

. _values.yaml_ - contains a set of variables. If these look familiar it's because they are - they're values that are required by the Argo CD Application CR.
. _Chart.yaml_ - simply contains some metadata about this Helm chart.
. _templates/_ - contains a set of Application CRs that reference the variables defined in _values.yaml_.

Argo CD supports Helm charts, so you can use it to create the App of Apps from this Helm chart:

. Open *your copy* of the https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt[workshop repository].
. Press the dot/period key to open the GitHub editor.
. Change the `repoURL` in _apps/templates/values.yaml_ to point to your repository's URL.
. Use the *Source Control* tab to commit and push the change.
. Return to the Web Terminal where you logged in to your Argo CD cluster as the `admin` user and run the following command (set `GITHUB_URL` to your repository's URL) to create the new *app-of-apps* Application:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export GITHUB_URL=https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt

argocd app create app-of-apps \
    --server openshift-gitops-server.openshift-gitops.svc.cluster.local \
    --dest-namespace openshift-gitops \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo $GITHUB_URL \
    --path apps
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the above command fails with an `Unauthenticated` error, repeat the `argocd` CLI login instructions you followed earlier.
====
. Return to the Argo CD dashboard and view the new *app-of-apps* Application. It should report that it's out of sync.
+
image::ex7.argo-cd-apps-out-of-sync.png[]
. Click on the *Sync* button, then click on the *Synchronize* button in the overlay that appears.
+
image::ex7.argocd-sync-apps.png[]
. Wait for the sync operation to complete, then return to the Argo CD dashboard *Applications* screen. It should look similar to the following screenshot:
+
image::ex7.argo-all-apps.png[]

Nice! You have configured the App of Apps. This created new *rbac* and *argo-projects* Applications that manage Argo CD Projects and OpenShift user Groups for your development teams.
