# First Steps with GitOps using Argo CD

⏱️ _Estimated Time: 5-10 Minutes_

👩‍💻 _Role: Cluster Administrator_

Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is based on the upstream https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD] project. This means that the https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[CRs] (resources defined using YAML or JSON) used to manage your resources and applications using Argo CD can be used with Red Hat OpenShift GitOps. 

== Understanding the Application CR

The https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications[Application CR] is provided by Argo CD to declaratively define, manage, and deploy applications on Kubernetes, and Kubernetes-based platforms such as Red Hat OpenShift. This CR allows you to synchronise resources in a Git repository to an OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.

Let's take a look at an example of an Application CR:

. View the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/etc/console-customisations.application.yaml[etc/console-customisations.application.yaml, window=_blank]_ file in *your copy* of the workshop repository. 
// TODO REPLACE THIS SCREENSHOT

. This file defines an https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications[Application]. Some notable fields include:
    * `spec.destination.server` - The target Kubernetes cluster. This Application will sync against the Kubernetes API in the same cluster that's running Red Hat OpenShift GitOps, i.e your OpenShift cluster.
    * `spec.source.repoURL` - Defines the Git repository that contains the resources that should be synchronised the the Kubernetes cluster specified in `spec.destination.server`.
    * `spec.project` - Argo CD has the concept of Projects. A Project can contain multiple Application instances, and can be used by to define RBAC. You will be using the `default` Project for now.
    * `spec.syncPolicy` - Specifies rules for the synchronisation behaviour. In this case, we want to automatically sync once per minute, remove resources (`prune`) if they've been removed from the Git repository, and enable self-healing (`selfHeal`) so our cluster state always matches what's specified in the Git repository.

[NOTE]
====
The concept of a Project in Argo CD is separate to the concept of an OpenShift Project. You'll learn more about these in subsequent sections of this workshop.
====

You'll use the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/etc/console-customisations.application.yaml[etc/console-customisations.application.yaml, window=_blank]_  file to create your first Application in Argo CD!

== Create an Argo CD Application using the Argo CD UI

The Application CR you examined in the prior section will be put to use now. Import the Application using the Argo CD dashboard:

. Return to the Argo CD dashboard. If you've forgotten how to access it, re-read the *Accessing the Cluster GitOps Dashboard* section of this workshop.
. Click the **New App** or **Create Application** button. A form will appear. You could use this form to define the Application, but there's no need since you already have a YAML file prepared. Take a moment to examine the form, then move to the next step.
. Click the **Edit as YAML** button.
+

. Replace the pre-defined YAML template with the contents of your _console-customisations.application.yaml_ from your GitHub repository.
. Edit the `spec.source.repoURL` field in the YAML to match the URL of *your copy* of the repository.
+

+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Failing to use the correct URL in the YAML will cause issues in subsequent sections. Make sure to replace that `REPLACE_THIS` text with your GitHub username or organisation!
====
. Click **Save**. Did you notice that the form has been updated to match the values that were defined in your YAML?
. Finally, click the **Create** button.

The Application will appear as a new tile named *console-customisations* in the Argo CD Dashboard, and should report both *Healthy* and *Synced* statuses.

Click on the tile to view the Application details. You should see a *welcome-banner* resource of type *consolenotification*, and a *workshop-repository* resource of type *consolelink*.

== Observing the Effects of your Application

You might be wondering what creating your Application in Argo CD achieved. If you return to the OpenShift Web Console it should be displaying a new banner at the top of the screen. 

This is the result of the Argo CD Application synchronising the custom resources in the _console-customisations/_ directory of your Git repository to the OpenShift cluster. Specifically, it synchronised a https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/web_console/customizing-web-console#creating-custom-notification-banners_customizing-web-console[ConsoleNotification CR] to the cluster.

== Syncing New Changes to the OpenShift Cluster

// TODO: Add screenshots to this section

Try changing the message in the Console Notification and committing it to your repository on GitHub:

. Visit your copy of the workshop repository at https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt[github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt]
. Open the _https://github.com/%USERID%/rht-summit-2023-gitops-cluster-mgmt/blob/main/console-customisations/console-notification.welcome-banner.yaml[console-customisations/console-notification.welcome-banner.yaml]_ file.
. Click the edit icon in the top-right corner.
+
image:ex2.gh-file-view.png[]
. Edit the `spec.text` to read `Fáilte chuig Red Hat Summit 2023!`, or a similar message of your choosing.
+
image:ex2.gh-file-edit.png[]
. Click the **Commit Changes...** button in the top-right.
. Enter a commit message, then click the **Commit Changes** button to commit to the `main` branch.
image:ex2.gh-file-commit.png[]

Verify that your new message is synced to the OpenShift cluster:

. Return to the Argo CD Dashboard and select the *console-customisations* application.
. Observe the **Last Sync Result** section. Depending on your timing it will be showing your latest commit message, or a prior commit message.
. If your latest commit message isn't shown, you can wait up to 3 minutes (this is the default Git polling interval) for Argo CD to perform a refresh, or use the **Refresh** button to for Argo CD to check the Git repository for changes.

Once the latest commit has been synced you should see your new message displayed at the top of the OpenShift Web Console.

== Summary

Congratulations! Managing a notification banner might seem like a trivial example, but you learned some important stuff in doing so!

You learned:

* About the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications[Application CR], and how to use it.
* How to create an *Application* from the Argo CD dashboard using the form, or YAML.
* That YAML resources can be synchronised to the OpenShift cluster automatically by Argo CD.
* That the OpenShift Web Console can be customised using https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/web_console/customizing-web-console#creating-custom-notification-banners_customizing-web-console[ConsoleNotification] and other supported CRs.
